templates_PiconsUpdater
=============================

This GIT Repository is used for enigma2-plugin-extensions-piconsupdater. 

How does the plugin work?
The plugin downloads picons and backgrounds from this repository - based on channels which are in your bouquets.
Within the plugin you can select target size of picons, target background of picons and the target location to generate the picons to.

Unfortunatly we currently support only Astra 19.2Â° . 

We need more transparent picons for other satelite orbital positions and for sure aswell DVB-C and DVB-T. 

##### Please fork us and add different satellites or DVB-C or DVB-T picons in 220x132 size (please save as RGB PNG).
##### Feel free to add additional backgrounds you want to have selectable in the plugin. 

The plugin will be very soon available to the public.
